things you may need:
- openmp library. usually comes if you do: module load openmpi
- to compile type make
- to use openmp parallelization: export OMP_NUM_THREADS=N where N = 1,2,..8 or higher depending on your system
- make run would run the program for density=0.8 and particle number N = 216
- for 1 thread (no parallelization), the program finishes in my system in 29 seconds.
